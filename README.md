### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Nigel, a part time coder from London; I actually studied this at university (Imperial, 86-89), but that was a very long time ago and we were taught things like Prolog and Modula-2.

I spent a large part of my working life writing for computer magazines, with material appearing regularly in UK titles such as Personal Computer World, Mac User, Computer Active, Computer Buyer, and more.

These days, I mostly spend my time running BLUF - the Breeches and Leather Uniform Fanclub - which is a social group for gay men into leather, with volunteers around the world. I co-ordinate all that, do that admin and also all the coding for our website an apps.

In my spare time, I've also written some apps to control e-stim devices from Windows, Mac and Android. So, I suppose you could say I work in the sex industry.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on integrating Prestashop and Ecwid stores into a custom social website
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about privacy issues, managing queer communities, dealing with sales after Brexit
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I created the UK's first internet discussion list for LGBT people, called uk-motss, in 1990.
